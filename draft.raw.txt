                      The third generation of RPSL

Abstract

   This memo presents some modifications to the Routing Policy
   Specification Language (RPSL), creating the third generation of the
   language.  It fixes some issues left from the previous standards, and
   enhances the language.  Enhancements include the addition of
   recommendations for using RPSL to describe routing policies in
   Internet Exchange environments running route servers and other minor
   corrections.
